## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This SRS defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Personal AI Core system. It serves as the single source of truth for requirements, from which all specifications, tasks, and acceptance criteria are derived.

### 1.2 Scope
The Personal AI Core is a modular AI ecosystem with 6 main modules (see [PRD.md](PRD.md)), a React web interface, and LangGraph-based agent orchestration. This SRS covers all user-facing and system-level requirements.

### 1.3 Definitions & Acronyms

## 3. The "5-Whys" of Agent Privacy
1. **Why must the agent use local-first storage?** To ensure the user has total data agency.
2. **Why is data agency a requirement?** To prevent the leakage of the user’s cognitive patterns and private credentials to third-party LLM providers.
3. **Why must we prevent this leakage?** Because the agent manages OAuth tokens for the user's financial and legal accounts.
4. **Why are these tokens handled by the agent?** Because the agent's core function is autonomous task execution across secure platforms.
5. **Why does this matter?** A leak constitutes a total compromise of the user's digital identity, creating professional and legal liability.

## 4. Traceability
Requirements are traced to implementation via the [TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md](TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md) file in this directory.
