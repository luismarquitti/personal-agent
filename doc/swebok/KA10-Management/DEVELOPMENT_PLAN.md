## 5. Risk Registry

| ID | Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|--------|------------|------------|--------|
| R1 | Over-bureaucratization slows development | High | Medium | Keep rules lightweight; hotfix escape hatch | Open |
| R2 | Agents ignore new rules | Medium | Low | Rules in standard `.agents/rules/` location | Open |
| R3 | SRS becomes stale | Medium | Medium | Doc-Sync step in governance workflow | Open |
| R4 | Too many KAs to address simultaneously | Medium | High | Phased approach: 5 KAs first | Mitigated |

## 6. Technical Debt Tracker

| ID | Description | Priority | Epic | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|------|--------|
| TD-01 | Existing epics lack formal SRS entries | Medium | EP-09 | ✅ Closed |
| TD-02 | No traceability matrix linking REQs to code | Medium | EP-09 | ✅ Closed |
| TD-03 | No formal threat model | High | EP-09 | ✅ Closed |

- **Deployment:** Implement project documentation sharing via GitHub Pages using MkDocs. Refer to [EPICOS.md](planning/EPICOS.md) and [BACKLOG.md](planning/BACKLOG.md).
- **Workflow:** Create an automated GitHub Issue Management workflow to coordinate between Planning and Execution.
