# Implementation Plan: Fundação Core & Infraestrutura (LangGraph Setup & Database)

## Phase 1: Environment & Foundation
- [x] Task: Configure Python environment (venv) and dependencies.
    - [x] Create `requirements.txt` with `langgraph`, `psycopg2`, `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`.
    - [x] Create `.env` template for database credentials.
- [x] Task: Setup PostgreSQL database connection.
    - [x] Write connection helper script.
    - [x] Write unit tests for database connection.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Environment & Foundation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: LangGraph Core
- [x] Task: Implement basic LangGraph with state.
    - [x] Define initial State schema.
    - [x] Write unit tests for state updates.
    - [x] Implement nodes and edges.
- [x] Task: Setup PostgresSaver for persistence.
    - [x] Configure `PostgresSaver` in the graph.
    - [x] Write unit tests to verify state persistence across restarts.
